        <li>I completed a project involving the classification of banana ripening stages within the realm of Machine Learning.</li><br>
        <li>Title of the project : A Novel Approach to classify the ripening stages of Banana
    <p><h4>A brief explanation:</h4>
    The system can be modeled by using Image segmentation techniques and YOLOv8 algorithm. 
    <br>The process of segmentation also involves filtering the images to remove noise and scanning artefacts and to enhance contrast.
    <br>Ultralytics YOLOv8 is the latest version of the YOLO object detection and image segmentation model. As a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, YOLOv8 builds on the success of previous versions, introducing new features and improvements for enhanced performance, flexibility, and efficiency.
    <br>This can minimize the training and the testing run time for banana fruits classification application.
